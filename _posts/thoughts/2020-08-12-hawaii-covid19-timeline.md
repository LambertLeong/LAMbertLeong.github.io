__Here is the data, make your own conclusions__

Things to consider and questions to ask:
- There is a delay in test results which is not yet adjusted for in the following plots
- There is a delay in reporting which is not yet adjusted for in the following plots
- If a nasal swab test is positive but the person has no symptoms, how confident are we that they are asymptomatic versus
they have a [false positive](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html){:target="_blank"}?

I have [experience in the biotech sector](../../experience/eyegenix) doing tissue culture and genetic analysis for many 
years.  It is a bit unusual to see collected specimens left out, not put in a temperature controlled enviornment, and not
labeled as a biohazard, with a sticker or red bag.

Things to think about:

Increase your healthspan via exercise, diet, etc.  This is not often focused on as a recommendation because the results
of wearing a mask and social distancing are more obvious and immediate.  Everyone, unfortunately,
will have some adverse health event.  The healthier you are (i.e. better healthspan) when you encounter an adverse health event, the
better your chances are of coming out of it and regaining your healthspan.
