  <h1>Hi, I am <span>Lambert.</span></h1>
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-size:20pt;">
    I am a Senior AI/ML Scientist at a Fortune 500 healthcare company, leveraging generative AI and language models to transform healthcare delivery, making it more efficient and impactful. My work combines cutting-edge AI with practical applications to address complex challenges in the healthcare industry.
    </span></p>
    
    <p align="justify"><span style="font-size:20pt;">
    Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the OncoRad Research Core at the University of Washington School of Medicine, where I focused on predictive biomarkers for clinical trials and treatment outcomes using multi-modal and longitudinal image modeling. I developed clinically impactful tools, including X-ray physics-informed neural networks and imaging biomarkers for breast cancer, significantly improving detection and risk quantification.
    </span></p>
    
    <p align="justify"><span style="font-size:20pt;">
    I hold a PhD in Bioengineering from the University of Hawaii, where my dissertation, <i>“Reducing the Burden of Cancer with Artificial Intelligence,”</i> introduced novel AI models for breast cancer detection. My academic background blends a Bachelor's in Biology and a Master's in Computer Science specializing in high-performance computing, giving me a unique perspective for tackling data-driven challenges in medicine.
    </span></p>
    
    <p align="justify"><span style="font-size:20pt;">
    With technical expertise in Python, Matlab, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, I excel at applying deep learning and generative AI to healthcare. My prior experience as a Machine Learning Research Intern at NASA's Anthropometry and Biomechanics Facility further honed my ability to translate AI innovations into real-world solutions, such as optimizing spacesuit design with 3D body scan visualizations.
    </span></p>
    
    <p align="justify"><span style="font-size:20pt;">
    Recognized for excellence with awards like the 2023 Outstanding Dissertation Award, I am also committed to mentorship and giving back to the scientific community through programs with Google and the National Institutes of Health.
    </span></p>
    
    <p align="justify"><span style="font-size:20pt;">
    Originally from Hawaii, I have a deep love for the outdoors. In my free time, you’ll find me hiking (the occasional trail run), enjoying the beach, and capturing photos of the incredible landscapes along the way.
