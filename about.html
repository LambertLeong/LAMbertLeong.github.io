  <h1>Hi, I am <span>Lambert.</span></h1>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size:20pt;" >

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher with the OncoRad Research Core in the Department of Radiology at the University
of Washington School of Medicine. I received my PhD in Bioengineering from the University of Hawaii, and my research
focus lies at the exciting intersection of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and medicine/healthcare.
My dissertation entitled, “Reducing the Burden of Cancer with Artificial Intelligence,” resulted in novel models using
state-of-the-art AI techniques to improve breast cancer detection and risk quantification.

<p align="justify"><span style="font-size:20pt;" >
My academic path began with a Bachelor's in Biology, followed by a Master's in Computer Science, focusing on
high-performance computing and simulation. This unique blend of biology and computer science drives my data-driven
research approach, allowing me to develop innovative solutions in medical imaging.
</span></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-size:20pt;" >
At OncoRad, I'm leading efforts to develop predictive biomarkers indicative of clinical trials and treatment outcomes,
utilizing multi-modal and longitudinal image modeling. My expertise in deep learning, particularly in vision tasks or
learning, has enabled me to create clinically relevant tools for cancer research. Notably, I've pioneered techniques in
X-ray physics-informed neural networks and identified novel imaging biomarkers for breast cancer, enhancing model
accuracy significantly.

My time as a Machine Learning Research Intern at NASA's Anthropometry and Bio-mechanics Facility honed my skills further,
where I applied my knowledge to improve spacesuit design using 3D body scan visualizations.
</span></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-size:20pt;" >
Recognition for my work includes honors like the 2023 Outstanding Dissertation Award from the University of Hawaii.
I'm also actively involved in the scientific community, participating in mentorship programs with Google and the
National Institutes of Health.
</span></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-size:20pt;" >
Technically proficient in Python, Matlab, C, Java, and various AI and ML frameworks (TF, torch, etch), I'm well-equipped
to tackle complex challenges in big data and medical imaging. My side projects, like the high-resolution photomosaic
generator program, reflect my passion for combining technical expertise in high performance computing and ML with
creative problem-solving.
</span></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-size:20pt;" >
I'm eager to explore opportunities where I can apply my unique skill set in biology and computer science. Collaborating
with innovative teams in tech or research, particularly those at the forefront of applied AI, ML for medicine, cancer,
and medical imaging, is where I see my career advancing. Let's connect and explore how my background and your
cutting-edge projects can create a significant impact in the field of healthcare technology.
