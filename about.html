  <h1>Hi, I am <span>Lambert.</span></h1>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size:20pt;" >
  Currently working at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center as a PhD student in the Molecular Bioscience
  and Bio-Engineering (MBBE) department.  I received my Masters in computer science where I focused on high
  performance computing and simulation.  My Bachelors degree is in biology and have work experience in biological,
  medical, and biomedical research. I am motivated by data driven research. I enjoy developing software and hope
  to work in an environment that allows me to continue to utilize both my backgrounds in biology and computer science.
